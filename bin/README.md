# bin

where all generated pypals live

.gitignore here blocks everything

move clones out of this folder and symlink them in. Then you can keep them in their own git repo.

```
ln -s /path/to/other/clones/bob /sing/bin/bob
```

# skeleton
blueprint for all clones. Stripped down to practically nothing.

# pypal
experimental. might start adding some common scripts here
