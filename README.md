Turn python snippets into command line buddies

## install

	$ python3.7 -m pip install pypals

## run

	$ python3 -m pypals sportsfan
	$ sportsfan doesn't exist, create them now? yes or no
	$ > yes
	$ your name?
	$ > mike

	$ I am listening...

sportsfan has been created, you can see him in /pypals directory. He can gather data about sports using any python commands you write and put in that folder

now try running this command...

	$ hello

look in pypals/sportsfan/hello/hello.py file to see an example of a command. Add as many commands as you like for your project.

All clones live in /pypals directory. Pass their name to summon. i.e...

	$ python3 -m pypals sportsfan
	$ mike I see you have returned!
	$ I am listening...
	$ hello
	$ Hello, to you mike!
	$ I am listening...
