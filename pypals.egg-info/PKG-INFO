        </h1>
        
        Keeps track of python scripts and snippets as command line pals.
        
        ## installation
        Get the package from PyPI i.e.
        
        	$ python3.7 -m pip install pypals
        
        ## usage
        Sometimes you write code maybe to do some random job or snippet, scrape something, send a tweet, whatever.
        
        It's useful to keep those bits of odd code somewhere. pypals are easy to remember ages later.
        
        	$ python3.7 -m pypals sportsfan
        	$ sportsfan doesn't exist, create them now? yes or no
        	$ > yes
        	$ your name?
        	$ > mike
        	$ Hi my name is sportsfan, Thankyou for creating me!
        	$ I am listening...
        
        sportsfan has been created, you can see him in /pypals directory. He can gather data about sports using any python commands you write and put in that folder
        
        now try running this command...
        
        	$ hello
        
        look in pypals/sportsfan/hello/hello.py file to see an example of a command. Add as many commands as you like for your project.
        
        Next try typing a command like 'scrape somesite for images'...
        
        You see it creates it for you. you can then just fill it in.
        
        Next try typing 'quit'
        
        If you're editing a python command you don't need to restart pypal. It will reload the command. so just type 'r' to rerun it.

        ## more
        ###  cron notes
        put in sometask.sh file chmod +x the file.
        
        	echo "do some job batch 1" | nohup python3.7 -m pypals jobs >/dev/null 2>&1 &
        
        - you may want those to self terminate *see 'quit'
        
        ### makefile notes
        something like this in your makefile to boot one or more faster
        
        ```
        pypal:
        	cd /home/ubuntu/Desktop/someapp/automate/; \
        	python3.7 -m pypals myscraper server.py
        ```
        
        If you run several pypals simoultaneously you can trash them all easy by putting this in your makefile:
        
        ```
        killall:
        	pkill -9 python
        ```
        
        ## documentation
        - note : you can't use package names for commands. i.e. builtins, test
        - note : use task manager to montior bots
        
        the base path to a command is available if loading writing files to same folder:
        
        o.context.COMMAND_PATH
        
        
        ### shortcuts 
        - r - re-run previous command
        - h - history
